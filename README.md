# GMBT
The GMBT is an Bluetooth audio interface that goes between the factory radio and if available the XM/Sirius turner. If there is no XM tuner then the interface will emulate the XM tuner. The interface is capable of switching between XM audio or Bluetooth audio. The interface has two CAN controllers so it can act as a gateway and can block/modify CAN messages coming from the XM to the radio or vise versa. 

I did not upload the libraries/drivers as of yet
